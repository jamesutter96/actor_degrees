# actor_degrees
This code finds the degrees of separation between two inputted actors.

There are two datasets that should be used a large and a small. The large dataset was too big of files to be able to upload to github. The small dataset
has a few actors names that can be tested on.

Note: the actors names must be in lowercase only and do not follow the last name by a space
